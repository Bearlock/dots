# Dots

Howdy folks, welcome to my dotfiles. Nothin' too exciting in here. Decided to finally pony up and stop starting over in regards to my config everytime I get a new machine :sweat_smile: 

## Kitty

[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is the new terminal I've decided to adopt. All kitty specific configs live in `.config/kitty`

## Neovim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is my beloved, sweet, sweet editor. I've customized it _some_. I expect I'll do more in the future. I've come to embrace the Lua-ization of Neovim since it is seriously so fast ha.
